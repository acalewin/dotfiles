General files of interest to a few other people.

Awesome config with a conkyrc that adds a pretty generic info bar to the bottom of the window.
The only thing of note that it has is a script to pull current reviews and lessons from WaniKani.

Edit the WK script and fill in your API where indicated. I have it running out of cron every five minutes and writing to a file in tmp.
